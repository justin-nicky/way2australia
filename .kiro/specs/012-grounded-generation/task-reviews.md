# Spec 012 — task reviews

## T1 — round 1

### Implementation
- Model: claude-sonnet-5-5 (Sonnet 5.5), run as a subagent; intended tier BEST_MINUS_ONE per `agent-skills/MODEL_PREFERENCES.md`, tier match not checked against the table.
- Files changed:
  - Moved (`git mv`, function unchanged) `evaluation/script_mix.py` to `packages/rag/src/way2australia_rag/script_mix.py`; import updated in `evaluation/retrieval_eval.py` and in `tests/evaluation/test_script_mix.py`. `evaluation/cli.py` has no `script_mix` import (only the `by_script_mix` slice key string), so it needed no edit. No re-export shim.
  - New `packages/rag/src/way2australia_rag/generation/`: `__init__.py` (docstring only, no exports), `config.py` (`ContextConfig`: `max_blocks` and `max_chars`, both `ge=1`), `context.py` (`EvidenceBlock`, `ContextStats`, `ContextBuilder`).
  - New `packages/rag/tests/generation/{__init__,test_context}.py` (18 tests).
- Verification run:
  - targeted `pytest packages/rag/tests/generation packages/rag/tests/evaluation` → 446 passed; `make lint typecheck` clean (0 pyright errors);
  - `HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1 HF_HOME=$(mktemp -d) make verify` (the single run) → 1512 passed, 3 skipped;
  - `git status --porcelain -- evaluation knowledge config` → empty.
  - Not run: `make test-integration` (T1 does not require it).
- Notes:
  - Budget: blocks are added in rank order; the first block that would exceed `max_blocks` or `max_chars` ends the list (so a lower-ranked block never fills a gap left by an oversized higher-ranked one). `dropped_by_budget` counts all remaining deduplicated hits. `chars` is the summed raw `chunk_text` length of kept blocks.
  - Normalization (NFC, whitespace to one space, strip) is the comparison key only; kept blocks hold the original `chunk_text`.
  - `ContextStats` lives in `generation/context.py` as the task says; T2 may move it to `models.py`.
  - The grep test reads names and codes from `config/language_registry.json` (display names, `product_support` keys, `internal_code` as a quoted literal) and scans every `generation/*.py`.
  - A code comment in `context.py` points to the design's no-neighbour-merge paragraph ("Data flow" step 2).

### Review
- Model: claude-opus-5-5 (Opus 5.5), run as a subagent; intended tier BEST (Claude Code `Opus`) matches.
- Verdict: PASS
- Commands: `uv run pytest packages/rag/tests/generation packages/rag/tests/evaluation` (via `python3 -m uv`) → 446 passed; `HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1 HF_HOME=$(mktemp -d) make verify` → pass (1512 passed, 3 skipped); `git status --porcelain -- evaluation knowledge config` → empty. `make test-integration` not required by T1, not run.
- Findings:
  - F1 [MINOR, SPEC_DEFECT, R13] The T1 box and design "Changed" table say `evaluation/cli.py` imports `script_mix`; at `HEAD` it does not (only the `by_script_mix` key string), so one import, not two, was updated. The implementer handled it correctly. → Record in the design As-built notes at T7; no code change.
  - F2 [MINOR, IMPLEMENTATION, R1] The grep test checks `product_support` keys, display names and quoted `internal_code`s (`ml`) but not a quoted `"en"` literal or `translation_pair` codes. Today `generation/` has neither; the check is narrower than "no language code literal". → Optionally widen it when `language.py` lands in T2 (where an `en` default is expected and must come from config or be explicitly allowed).
- Summary for user (PASS only):
  - Changed: new `generation/` package with `ContextConfig` and `ContextBuilder` (NFC/whitespace exact-text dedup keeping the higher rank, no neighbour merge, whole-block budget by `max_blocks`/`max_chars`, IDs `S1…Sn`, metadata copied from the hit payload, counts in `ContextStats`); `script_mix.py` moved to the package root with one import updated.
  - Verified by: 18 new context tests, the evaluation tests (446 in the targeted run) and one hub-free `make verify` (1512 passed, 3 skipped); protected paths clean.
  - Worth your attention: the budget stops at the first block that does not fit, so an oversized top-ranked block yields zero blocks (and the T4 pre-gate will then refuse with `no_evidence`) rather than letting lower-ranked blocks through; this matches design step 2 ("stop adding blocks"). `ContextStats` lives in `context.py` for now; T2 may move it to `models.py`.
  - Reading order (follow the flow: entry point → core logic → models/errors/config → tests):
    1. `packages/rag/src/way2australia_rag/generation/context.py` → `ContextBuilder.build`: dedup, budget, ID assignment; `EvidenceBlock`, `ContextStats`.
    2. `packages/rag/src/way2australia_rag/generation/config.py` → `ContextConfig`: the two budget caps.
    3. `packages/rag/tests/generation/test_context.py`: behaviour tests and the language grep test.
    4. Supporting edits: `script_mix.py` move (`git mv`), import in `evaluation/retrieval_eval.py` and `tests/evaluation/test_script_mix.py`, `generation/__init__.py`, `tests/generation/__init__.py`.
